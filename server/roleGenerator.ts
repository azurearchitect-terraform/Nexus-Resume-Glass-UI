Optimize this structured resume data for the target role: ${targetRole || 'Professional'}.

${brainDump ? `ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (BRAIN DUMP): ${brainDump}\nSift through this raw data to extract hidden achievements.` : ''}

ROLE DATA:

CORPORATE DNA TAILORING (DEMONSTRATE, DO NOT DECLARE):
${targetCompany ? `Tailor appropriately for ${targetCompany}. Focus on specific impacts and technologies relevant to their industry.` : ''}

GLOBAL SYSTEM RULES (STRICT ENFORCEMENT):
1. ZERO-SHOT ANTI-HALLUCINATION: Use ONLY the provided role data. Do NOT invent numbers, percentages, budgets, or metrics.
2. TENURE & TIMELINE AWARENESS: 
   - For short tenures (under 6 months): Focus on "Rapid Delivery," "Auditing," or "Assessment." CRITICAL: Do NOT alter the job title or append the word "(Contract)" to short roles. Leave the title exactly as provided.
3. BREVITY & DENSITY: Recruiters skim. Bullet points should be concise and impactful. Prioritize hard skills, tools, and metrics.
4. COMPREHENSIVE DETAIL: Include all significant achievements provided in the source ROLE DATA. Do not arbitrarily cap the number of bullet points unless necessary for layout (aim for high impact).
5. CLOUD & INFRASTRUCTURE: Use professional terminology naturally.
6. NO ARBITRARY COMPRESSION: Older roles should still be accurately represented with multiple bullet points if the source data contains them.
7. ACCURATE TERMINOLOGY: Include all relevant technical skills and tools (e.g., CI/CD, DevOps, Cloud Platforms) as they appear in the source data.
8. PLAYER-COACH MODE: ONLY IF mode is 'Player-Coach':
   - BALANCE: 60% Execution (Azure infra), 40% Leadership (Mentoring, Architecture reviews).
   - HYBRID VOCABULARY: Use "Architected & Led," "Designed & Mentored," "Engineered & Standardized."
9. GOOGLE XYZ FORMULA: ALL high-impact bullets MUST conform to the formula: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]."
   - [X] = The impact or accomplishment. What did you achieve?
   - [Y] = The metrics, data, or scale. (Example: "Improving performance by 20%", "Generating $50k revenue", "Supporting 1M+ active users").
   - [Z] = The mechanism, action, or skill used. (Example: "By implementing Terraform modules", "By re-architecting Azure SQL database").
   - IF A BULLET HAS NO METRICS: You MUST pivot the phrasing to highlight the result of the action (e.g., "Led migration of [App] to [Cloud], reducing latency and improving deployment frequency" - implicit metrics).


OUTPUT SCHEMA:
Return ONLY a valid JSON array of strings containing the high-impact bullet points for this role. Do not include keys, objects, or markdown formatting outside the array. Example: ["Bullet 1", "Bullet 2"]
